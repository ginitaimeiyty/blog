# Principles of computer composition

### The basic components of a computer system
&emsp;&emsp;It consists of computer hardware system and computer software system<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Computer hardware system: a general term for physical equipment such as electronic circuits and electronic components that constitute a computer system. Hardware is the material basis of computer and the core of computer system
Computer software system: the method of solving problems, ideas and processes are described by programs, which are the core components of software. Programs are usually stored on media. The collection of all programs in a computer is collectively referred to as the software system of the computer, which is divided into two categories according to its functions: application software and system software<br>

### The relationship between computer software and hardware

&emsp;&emsp;Operating system: The operating system is the software that manages various resources of the computer, automatically schedules user jobs, and handles various interruptions. Resources managed by the operating system, usually hardware, software, and data information. The size and functionality of the operating system can be large or small, depending on the requirements. Common operating systems include DOS, UNIX, Windows, and Linux<br>

### The working process of a computer system


&emsp;&emsp;The program and data installed in the main memory from the program's starting address allows the program to take out the first instruction from the memory with the program's first address, complete the instruction function through a series of steps such as decoding and execution, calculate the address of the next instruction with the obtained address continue to read the second instruction execution, until the end of the program each instruction is completed in the cycle of taking the finger, decoding and execution<br>


### Computer performance index


&emsp;&emsp;Basic performance indicators: Word length: generally refers to the basic length of the data involved in a single operation, measured by the length of binary digits. Word length affects computer performance in the following ways：<br>

The accuracy of calculation is affected. The longer the word length, the higher the calculation accuracy, and the lower the calculation accuracy<br>
Affects the scope of the data representation. The longer the word length, the larger the range of data representation<br>
The operation speed is affected. When there are more data bits to be calculated and the word length is relatively short, it is necessary to complete the calculation task after several operations, which reduces the calculation speed<br>



### 【The relationship between bits, bytes, words, and word lengths in computers】

&emsp;&emsp;Bits or bits. An electronic circuit unit is called a "bit", which has two stable working states, respectively represented by "0" and "1". It is the smallest unit of data in a computer.
byte. The 8-bit binary number is called a "byte" (B for short). It is the basic unit of computer storage information and the most basic capacity unit of computer storage space size.
The word (word). Several bytes make up a "word". A word can hold a computer instruction or a piece of data.
It is word length. The binary length that each word in the CPU can contain is called the "word size". The longer the word, the more information can be transmitted in the same amount of time. The word length of the microcomputer is 16 bits (two bytes), 32 bits (four bytes), 64 bits (eight bytes) and so on.<br>
